        "en": "The rail network in Adelaide, South Australia, consists of four lines (six including two short spurs) and 89 stations, totalling 132 km (82 mi). It is operated by Keolis Downer under contract from the Government of South Australia, and is part of the citywide Adelaide Metro public transport system.\nAll lines around Adelaide were originally 1,600 mm broad gauge. The main interstate lines out of Adelaide towards Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Darwin have been progressively converted to 1,435 mm standard gauge, but the suburban system and a few freight-only branch lines to the north remain broad gauge."
